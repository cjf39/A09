	<h2>Movie reviews</h2>
	
<p><blockquote><q>Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of <br>the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but<br> the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing.</q></blockquote></p>
	
<p><blockquote><q>I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their <br> families, descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.</q></blockquote></p>
